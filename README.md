Homework 5

# Description
This is my submitted work for Homework 5 - Work Day Scheduler.  The assignment was to create a day planner with several caveats and rules.

The planner needs to:
* Display the current day at the top of the planner
* View timeblocks for standard business hours 9-5.  Those blocks are colored differently based on if the hour is past, present, future.
* Clicking inside a timeblock allows data entry
* Clicking the save button beside each timeblock saves data for that timeblock locally
* Loading/Refreshing the page retrieves data from local storage

# Extra Information
* Most of the CSS, as well as a portion of HTML was provided for this project.
* The provided HTML used the jumbotron component from bootstrap.  I continued using the bootstrap row/column functionality.
* I used font awesome for the save buttons

# Usage
Website can be accessed at: https://jdeleonardis.github.io/homework_5_day_planner/

To use the website, enter data in a time block.  Press the save button to the right of the time block to save information in local storage.
